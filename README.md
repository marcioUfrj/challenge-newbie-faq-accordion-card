## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup: {picture, img}
- CSS custom properties: Position, Object-fit, Object-position
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

How to use HTML to dynamically select the image's source.
How to use CSS to position a image.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 440px)" srcset="./images/bg-pattern-desktop.svg">
  <img src="./images/bg-pattern-mobile.svg" alt="img-big-pattern" class="img-big-pattern">
</picture>
```
```css
.img-big-pattern {
  /* image configuration */
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: none;
  object-position: right -300px;
  /* image position */
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

Coding the JavaScript code to add the "event listener" was a such a pain in the neck. I'm new to JavaScript and I need to study a lot more to be more confortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Object-fit](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.aspm) - Helped to configure how an image fit within it's frame.
- [CSS Object-position](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-position.asp) - Helped to position the images' frames within it's frame.
- [CSS Position](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - Helped to position an container within it's parent container.
